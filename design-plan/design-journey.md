# Project 3: Design Journey

Plan your team responsibilities and plan your site's design.

## Team Responsibilities

Like in industry, you will work with another person to complete this larger project. For some tasks, you will complete them together with your peer and for other tasks, you will complete them individually.

Like in industry, each team member will be assigned a lead for part of the project. One team member will be primarily responsible for the **consumer** portion of the site and the other team member will be primarily responsible for the **admin** portion of the site.

Identify the leads below. Who is primarily responsible for the consumer and admin parts of the website?

| **Consumer** Lead | **Admin** Lead |
| ----------------- | -------------- |

Complete the **consumer** and **admin** design journeys _individually_.

If you need to revise your design/plan, please revise the plan in the original milestone file.
When updating, do **not** delete your original plan. Leave your original plan in place and append to it. Place your new plan _below_ the original and then explain why you are changing your plan.
