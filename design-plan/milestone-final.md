# Project 3, Final Milestone: **Team** Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.


## Milestone 3 Team Feedback Revisions
> Explain what your **team** collectively revised in response to the Milestone 3 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

We did not make any changes since we had adhered to the guidelines.

## Collective Implementation
> Explain how your team **collectively** implemented sessions and user access controls. (1-2 sentences)
> If one person did not contribute, simply state that.

We both implemented the sign-in/sign-out options. However, one of us focused more on the design/css side (consumer), and the other focused more on the functionality. However, we both helped each other out and were able to experience both sides!
