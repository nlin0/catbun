[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.


## Milestone 1 Feedback Revisions
> Explain what your team revised in response to the Milestone 1 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

We did not do any revisions in response to the Milestone feedback. This is because we were satisfied with what we had thus far.
