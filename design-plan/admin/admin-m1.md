# Project 3, Milestone 1: **Administrator** Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](../design-journey.md)

## _Cohesive_ Audience
> Briefly explain your site's **administrator** audience.
> Your audience should be specific, but not arbitrarily specific.

This site's administrator audience will be artists who have a collection of personal artworks they want to display in an online portfolio.

> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group. (1-2 sentences)

This is a cohesive audience because it focuses specifically on illustrators who have the shared goal of wanting to track and publically display their artwork online.

## Audience Goals
> Document your **administrator** audience's goals.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need
> enough to do the job (Hint: It's at least 1, but probably no more than 3).

Goal 1: Keep track of the types of artworks they have

Goal 2: Organize different artworks along with inserting and updating the artwork's history (brief, date/time completed, medium)


## Persona
> Use the goals you identified to develop a persona of your site's **administrator** audience.
> Your persona must have a name and a face. The face can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.
> You may type out the persona below with bullet points or include an image of the persona.
> Just make sure it's easy to read the persona when previewing markdown.
