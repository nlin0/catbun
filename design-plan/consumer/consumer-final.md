## Milestone 3 Feedback Revisions
> Explain what you individually revised in response to the Milestone 3 feedback (1-2 sentences)

No revisions were made. This is because the part where I lost points on was because I think the grader at the time just couldn't locate admin-upload.php

## Self-Reflection

> How have you improved from projects 1 and 2?
> What would you do differently next time? (1-2 sentences)

I really enjoyed the assignment. However I do feel like this class doesn't really listen to it's students. Next time, I will likely not take any more creative liberties.


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (1-2 sentences)

I feel like I learned a lot in this class. I learned about SQL, and I also enjoyed learning about sessions.
